# The Problem
The idea for this application was born after a friend had requested if I could make him an app that would assist in improving his music production skills. 

After intently listening to his beats that he made, I found that a very significant issue with his music is the fact that he just used random chords and placed them next to one another, therefore, they sounded fairly unprofessional.
