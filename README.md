# Chord Sheet

## The Problem
The idea for this application was born after a friend had requested if I could make him an app that would assist in improving his music production skills. 

After intently listening to his beats that he made, I found that a very significant issue with his music is the fact that he just used random chords and placed them next to one another, therefore, they sounded fairly unprofessional.

## The Solution
Therefore, I had to determine the best course of action, which was to create an app that ALREADY outlines the chords, but provides a method to actually learn how to string these chords together. 

I then started brain storming the overall design, and came up with the idea of including a form that outputs the "feel" for each key selected and also the chords that work in the given key. 

## Final Thoughts
Ultimately, I am incredibly happy with how this application turned out. 

As mentioned in the above video, there are currently 3 people utilizing the application to assist in improving their own beats, which is much more than I initially was expecting. Honestly, I have a lot of ideas to improve this application in the future, including the possibility of actually recording the chord progressions, and even being able to download the final mp4 or MIDI file.
